WooCommerce Plivo Plugin
========================
This Plivo plugin for WordPress WooCommerce enables the use of the popular platform for building voice and SMS enabled applications, [Plivo](http://www.plivo.com). We aim to integrate most of the features the Plivo API has to offer, but for now, we'll stick to implementing SMS order notifications.

Current possibilities:
* Auto send status updates
* Send a test SMS
* Edit status SMS notifications
* Send an SMS from the order page

Requirements
------------
php-openssl, php-curl, pear package HTTP_Request2

Installation
------------
Simply download the plugin from the WordPress plugin repository, or download the current working version from Github.
