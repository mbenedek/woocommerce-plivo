WooCommerce Plivo Plugin
========================
The WooCommerce Plivo plugin enables the use of the popular platform for building voice and SMS enabled applications, [Plivo](http://www.plivo.com). We aim to integrate most of the features the Plivo API has to offer, but for now, we'll stick to implementing SMS order notifications.
